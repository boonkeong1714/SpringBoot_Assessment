**===== Reflection Questions =====**  

1. What did you like about this project?  
   One of the objective I signed up for this JFSD programe is to be able to create an app.
   This project is a baby step for me to achieve this goal.
   I am glad that I am able to complete it.

2. What did you struggle with in this project?  
 * The 415 Unsupported Media Type error: 
   Class exercise uses content-type=formdata to post data to database. 
   But somehow database only accepts Json format.
   After one whole day of Google searching and testing, I managed to convert formdata to Json by using JSON.stringify method.
    
 * Dealing with date (Target Date) using LocalDate type.

3. What would make your experience with this assessment better?  
  This project only involves "Create" and "Read" functions (from CRUD).
  If the class exercise also cover "Update" and "Delete" operation, 
  then we will be able to master all CRUD operation.
  (The class exercise is very useful as it shows how Spring framework works.)
